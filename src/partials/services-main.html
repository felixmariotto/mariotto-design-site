			Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) have become the standard workflow in the jewelry and even the high jewelry industry. CAD and CAM improve manufacturers speed, quality management, and adaptability.
			<br><br>
			Mariotto Design gathered experience of 3D modeling for technical product design with several of the most demanding jewelry manufacturers. Designing a perfect piece of jewelry requires having a good understanding of the whole crafting process, to create parts than can be perfectly produced, assembled, polished, set with stones, and plated. When in doubt about any stage of the processing of a particular jewelry piece, Mariotto Design can rely on a dependable network of experts and advisors. If you didn't reach the highest quality standards yet, we can help you attain it.

			It is now possible to produce artificial images of jewelry pieces so realistic that most people wouldn't spot them as 3D rendered.
			<br><br>
			This technique has many benefits over traditionnal photography. First of all, the items don't have to actually exist, which can save time in promoting new products, or help in testing the market for potential new designs that you didn't start manufacturing. It also helps the design process by allowing to iterate easily upon metal and gem materials.
			<br><br>
			Mariotto Design is able to use cutting-edge tools and technology to produce computer-generated imagery up to your expectations.
